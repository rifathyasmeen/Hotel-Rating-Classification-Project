HOTEL RATING CLASSIFICATION PROJECT

A sample dataset which consists of 20,000 reviews and ratings for different hotels and our goal is to examine how travellers are communicating their positive and negative experiences in online platforms for staying in a specific hotel and major objective is what are the attributes that travellers are considering while selecting a hotel. With this manager can understand which elements of their hotel influence more in forming a positive review or improves hotel brand image.
